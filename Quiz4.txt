 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.


 10. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your 
     Student ID at the top and below that, your name, at the top of every web page dispayed 
     (for this quiz). Please use a large font.

     For this question (only this question), 
     Using a web interface (web page) allow a user to give a number N, and the names of N fruits,
     for example for N=2, "grape" and "figs", show a pie chart with N slices, 
     where each pie slice represents the fraction of grapes and figs from that group, in this case there are 2 grapes and 4 figs,
     so 66% should be figs and 33% grapes.

     Each pie slice should be in a different color, please show the percent labels outside each slice.
     The pie chart should occupy between 50 and 60% of the screen width. 

 11. On a web form, please allow a user, to give the same values as the previous question, and show a vertical bar chart 
     with N bars colored green, where the height of each bar is the proportian of that fruit. Show only the largest N fruit
     values, for example for N = 3, those are apple, banana, cherry.
     Please put labels inside each bar. 

 12. On a web form, please allow a user, to give a range of values Low to High (L,H) for values in column 1
     (for example 220 to 250) and show a point chart (scatter chart) with those values from column 1 for the X axis
     and the corresponding values from column 3 on the Y axis.
     Please scale this chart to be readable and make sense, and label the X and Y axis.
     Please note: You will need to scale the X and Y axis, as well as label the X and Y axis.

 13. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 10, 11, 12

 14. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
